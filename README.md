## Vulnerability Description
It was found that polkit could be tricked into bypassing the credential checks for D-Bus requests, elevating the privileges of the requestor to the root user. This flaw could be used by an unprivileged local attacker to, for example, create a new local administrator. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

## Exploit Description
Use this exploit on a system with vulnerable Polkit software to add a new user with Sudo privileges. Specify a custom username and/or password as CLI arguments, if desired.

## Usage
```bash
  python3 exploit-CVE-2021–3560.py [-u <username> -p <password>]
  python3 exploit-CVE-2021–3560.py -h
```

## Options
```bash
  -u    Custom username. Provide username to be created. (Optional)
  -p    Custom password. Provide password to be configured for user. (Optional)
